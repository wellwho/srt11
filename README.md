# srt11

`srt11` uses ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech (TTS) to convert an `.srt` (or `.vtt`) subtitle file into a WAV audio track, matching the subtitle timings. This enables easy replacement of audio tracks in videos using only subtitles.

## Download

Pre-built binaries for Linux, Windows, and Mac are available at:  
[https://github.com/dkarlovi/srt11/releases/latest](https://github.com/dkarlovi/srt11/releases/latest)

## Usage

1. Create the config file [`config.yaml`](./config.yaml.dist) as so:
    ```yaml
    auth_key: "sk_your_auth_key"
    default:
        model: "model_id"
        name: "Speaker name"
        speed: 1.1
    # Optional: merge lines if same speaker and gap is below this threshold (in ms)
    merge_lines_threshold_ms: 50
    models:
        # Optional: add custom speakers
        # https://github.com/dkarlovi/srt11?tab=readme-ov-file#speakers
        Joe:
            model: "joe_model_id"
            name: "Joe"
    ```
2. create [the ElevenLabs API key](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys) and paste as `auth_key` into the config file
3. download the [latest release](https://github.com/dkarlovi/srt11/releases/latest) appropriate for your system and unpack somewhere
4. from the folder where you keep your `config.yaml`, run the binary like so:
    ```sh
    srt11 data/130_EN.vtt
    ```
5. this will process the VTT/SRT file and produce output similar to this:
    ```
    2025/05/23 16:07:17 No merge threshold set, not merging lines
    #001
    ...so you shouldn't eat any teeth half an hour before...
    Speaker:  Hana, speed: 1.00
    Subtitle: 0s --> 2.69s (duration 2.69s)
    Audio:    0s --> 3.657s (duration 3.657s)
    Path:     /home/dkarlovi/Development/OSS/srt11/data/96EB5561-Hana-so_you_shouldnt_eat_any_teeth_half_an_hour_before.jajumpwyk0xFZQn4P41i.mp3
   
    (...stuff...)

    2025/05/23 16:07:18 Final audio track written to data/130_EN_2025-05-23-16-07-17.wav
    ```
6. the file is ready to be used

## Speakers

By default, all lines are read by the `default` speaker. You can override this per line in one of these ways (they are mutually exclusive and detected in this order):
 
1. Add a VTT speaker (only `.vtt` files):
    ```
    00:22.980 --> 00:23.300
    <v Matko>What do we do?</v>
    ```
2. Add a VTT comment (only `.vtt` files):
    ```
    NOTE Matko
    00:22.980 --> 00:23.300
    What do we do?
    ```
3. Add in square brackets in front of the line:
    ```
    00:22.980 --> 00:23.300
    [Matko]What do we do?
    ```

Each named speaker must be defined in the `config.yaml` file. The default speaker is used if no speaker is defined.

## Speed

The speed of the audio can be adjusted in the config file. The default is 1.0, but you can set it to any value between 0.7 and 1.3. The speed is per speaker.

## TTS model

By default, `srt11` generates speech with the [`eleven_multilingual_v2`](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/models) ElevenLabs model. You can choose a different model with the optional `tts_model` field, either globally or per speaker:

```yaml
auth_key: "sk_your_auth_key"
# Applies to every speaker unless overridden below
tts_model: "eleven_multilingual_v2"
default:
    model: "model_id"
    name: "Speaker name"
    speed: 1.1
models:
    Joe:
        model: "joe_model_id"
        name: "Joe"
        # Overrides the top-level tts_model just for Joe
        tts_model: "eleven_flash_v2_5"
```

The model is resolved per line in this order: the speaker's own `tts_model`, then the top-level `tts_model`, then the built-in default (`eleven_multilingual_v2`). Omitting the field entirely keeps the previous behaviour, so existing configs are unaffected.

> [!NOTE]
> `tts_model` is the ElevenLabs **model** (the synthesis engine). The `model` field under each speaker is the ElevenLabs **voice ID** and is unrelated.

> [!WARNING]
> `srt11` relies on the per-speaker `speed` setting and on [request stitching](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/eleven-api/guides/how-to/text-to-speech/request-stitching) for timing and cross-line continuity. Neither is supported by `eleven_v3`, so that model is not recommended here. `eleven_multilingual_v2` and the `eleven_flash_v2_5` / `eleven_flash_v2` models support both and are safe choices.

The selected model is included in the generated file's cache key, so switching models re-generates audio instead of reusing files produced by a different model. The run log also prints the model used for each line, e.g. `Speaking (as Joe via eleven_flash_v2_5)`.

## Merge lines

If you have multiple lines in a row spoken by the same speaker, you can merge them into line.
You can either set the `merge_lines_threshold_ms` in the config file or use the `-m` / `--merge-lines-threshold` flag when running the program.

The default is no merging.
